#Typography style 

Font: Arial .Helvetica ,sans-serif and  Story Script ,cursive .

Line-height 1.6 adds extra space between the text and makes paragraph much easier to read preventing the text to look crowed .

Main heading h1 Font size 4rem was used very large and bold so the website title can catch attention , Sub headings h2,h3,h4,h5 font size is 22px keeping them large enough to be seen important as h1.h1 's paragraph is 1.4375rem its a little bigger than the normal body text making it easy to introduce the main points .
