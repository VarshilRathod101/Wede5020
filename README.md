-PART 3

-Accordions

These are sections on a page that can open or close when you click on them. Each heading can be clicked to show or hide the content below it. Using JavaScript or jQuery, accordions keep the page neat and make it easier for users to read only the information they want .This is at the end of the tutorial page having tips for equipments .

-Lightbox Modal

So in the index page the first 7 images and in the product page all images  by clicking on the images opens them in a full screen model .The JS dynamically updates the models to match the clicked images and add glow effects .

-Interactive Maps

In the contact page there are two maps .
Interactive zoom users can  zoom in and out the + and - or mouse scroll .
Move around clicks and drag the map to check other areas.
Fullscreen option here user can expand the map to Fullscreen for better view .
live map features user can interact with real map elements like places ,directions and labels .

-Animations and Transitions

Banner animation every banner images uses popin keyframe animation to scale in and fade in smoothly .
Navigation hover effects so the navigations glow when we hover or click it .
Images hover effect so the images in the index page hover when and when we click the images in index and products the full scale with a glow effect .

-Advanced DOM Manipulation

Form Validation dynamically check inputs in the order and review forms. For invalid fields error messages are displayed or alerts are triggered and preventing submission until the user corrects the input.
Search Functionality the search input filters all product sections (wedcake,custome cake ,cupcake and pastries) by comparing the figcaption text with the search query. Sections without matches are hidden, and a “No results found” message is dynamically shown or hidden.

-Gallery with Lightbox

Clicking on an image opens a lightbox overlay (#lightbox) with a larger view of the image.
The glow around the lightbox image is determined by the image’s data-glow attribute (e.g., aqua, lawngreen), creating a visually engaging effect.
Users can close the lightbox via the .close button, making navigation intuitive.

-Search Functionality to Filter Content

Users can type keywords in the search input.
JavaScript iterates over each section and each product’s figcaption.
Products that match the search query remain visible; non-matching products are hidden.
Sections without any visible products are hidden entirely along with their heading.
If no products match, a “No results found” message is dynamically displayed within the main content area.
This functionality provides realtime filtering, improves usability, and makes it easy for users to quickly find specific products. It’s a practical example of combining DOM manipulation with user input to enhance the interactivity of a website.

-Keyword Research

The website uses important words and phrases that people might search for when looking for your bakery, like “Royal Cakes,” “Bakery Johannesburg,” or “Cake orders.” These words are added naturally in headings, paragraphs, and website tags so search engines can find your site. Using city or neighborhood names (like “Johannesburg” or “Blairgowrie”) helps people nearby find your bakery more easily.

-Title Tags and Meta Descriptions

Each page in your project includes descriptive title tags and meta descriptions:
Example from contact page:
<title>Contact Royal Cakes - Bakery Address, Phone & Social Media</title>
<meta name="description" content="Get in touch with Royal Cakes! Find our addresses in Blairgowrie and Mayfair, phone numbers, email, and follow us on Instagram and TikTok. Our team is ready to help with your cake orders.">
Title tags are represtive, include main keywords, and accurately describe the page.
Meta descriptions are informative, encourage clicks, and include relevant keywords without stuffing.

-Header Tags

pages are well structured with heading tags for content hierarchy:
<h1 class="main-title">Contact Information</h1> → Page-level title
<h2 class="detail">Address</h2> → Section headings
<h3 class="detail">Operating hours</h3> → Subsections
<h4 id="map">Map locations</h4> → Nested headings
This structure improves readability and SEO by signaling content importance to search engines.

-Image Optimisation Every image has good file names and have descriptive alt .

<img src="images/contact_banner.png" alt="Royal Cakes contact banner">

-URL Structure

There are simple and well structed making it easy understand .
ndex.html → Home
contact.html → Contact
products.html → Products
tutorial.html → Tutorial
enqiury.html → Enquiry and order 
about.html → about us 

-Internal Linking

Navigation links provide strong internal linking
nav>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="about.html">About Us</a></li>
        <li><a href="products.html">Products</a></li>

        <li><a href="tutorial.html">Tutorial</a></li>
        <li><a href="contact.html">Contact</a></li>
    </ul>
</nav>
Users can navigate easily between pages, which distributes link equity and improves SEO.

-Mobile-Friendliness

CSS includes responsive design using media queries:
Flexible grids for products, promotions, and video sections.
Adjusted navigation and banner for tablets and mobile devices.
Scalable images and lightbox for small screens.

-Social Media 

There are 2 link at the end of the contact page which are tiktok and instagram .

-Local SEO

contact page includes multiple location-based signals:
Street addresses for Blairgowrie and Mayfair.
Embedded Google Maps.
Phone numbers and email.
This helps search engines understand your business location, improving visibility for local searches like “bakery near me in Johannesburg”

-Form Elements

The enquiry and contact Both forms use appropriate input types for different data text fields for names, email fields for email addresses, password fields for secure input, and textareas for longer messages. Labels are used correctly for each input and making sure the forms are accessible and easy to understand. Required fields ensure that essential information is collected before submission.

-Form Validation

Validation is used both through HTML5 attributes and JavaScript. Required fields prevent empty submissions, and input types like email and tel ensure proper formatting.
JavaScript adds extra checks for:
Valid email format.
Password length (minimum characters).
Phone number length and numeric format.
Order scetion and revew scetion check.

-Form Submission

So in the enquiry page the submit buttons for both order and review sections the information is added to the file .

##changelog

-Date :2025.11.15

Removed the action attribute from the order-form and review-form. This allows JavaScript to handle form validation and submission dynamically and giving better control over error handling and user feedback before the form is sent.

-Date: 2025.11.16

Added a contact form to the contact page. The form includes fields for Username, Email, Password, and Message, with HTML5 validation rules for required inputs, minimum lengths, and proper formats. This allows users to submit messages to ROYAL CAKES easily and ensures that input is valid before submission.

Took out  the click to enlarge functionality for the DrD image and the Royal Member card on the index page. This was done because enabling full-size view caused a bug, and removing the feature ensured the page functions correctly without errors.

-Date : 2025.11.16

Updated the contact or location section by replacing static images with interactive Google Maps iframes. Added two maps showing Blairgowrie and Mayfair locations. Users can now zoom, pan, and explore the locations directly on the page, improving navigation and user engagement.

-Date : 2025.11.17

Added a tutorial section titled “Baking Equipment Tips” on the tutorial page. Implemented interactive accordion elements for each piece of equipment (Measuring Cups, Mixing Bowl, Rolling Pin, Whisk) so users can click to reveal tips. Each panel includes an image and a list of practical tips, helping users learn proper usage of baking tools.
